//! Failure packets: everything a root-cause agent needs, without the search.
//!
//! A bare `FAIL` line costs an agent a long investigation before it can even
//! start. A packet pins the exact run (seed, scenario, config, digests), the
//! first step whose execution broke an invariant, the state immediately before
//! and after that step, the faults that were active, and the coordinator
//! symbols the violated invariant implicates. It is the difference between
//! "something is wrong" and "work here".
//!
//! The packet is derived, never invented: every field comes from the outcome
//! of a real run of the real coordinator. When a field cannot be known (the
//! commit, for instance, outside a checkout) it says so instead of guessing.

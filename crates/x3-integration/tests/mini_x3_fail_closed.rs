//! The interpreter the chain actually runs must refuse what it cannot execute.
//!
//! There are two readers of X3BC and two interpreters of its opcodes: `x3-backend`/`x3-vm` on the
//! `std` side, and `x3-integration::mini_x3`, which exists because `pallets/x3-kernel` has to
//! execute `.x3` inside the runtime, and the runtime has no `std`. The node builds its executor
//! with `sc_service::new_wasm_executor` (`node/src/service.rs`), so **`mini_x3` is the only
//! interpreter that runs on chain** — the `std` VM is reached by tools, tests and off-chain
//! simulation, never by a block.
//!
//! That makes any fabricated answer in `mini_x3` a fabricated answer in consensus. It used to hold
//! a block of arms that decoded their operands, wrote a placeholder into the destination register
//! and moved on:
//!
//! ```text
//! 0x14 / 0x15  LoadIndex / StoreIndex      dst = I64(0)
//! 0x16 / 0x17  LoadField / StoreField      dst = I64(0)
//! 0x70..0x75   arrays and tuples           dst = I64(0) / Unit, or a silent no-op
//! 0x80..0x85   context reads               a zero sender, height, timestamp, value, or 3375
//! 0x90..0x93   atomic window               tracked and skipped, nothing ever reverted
//! 0xA0..0xA2   agent / emit                Unit, or the event dropped
//! 0xB0..0xB9, 0xC0..0xC7, 0xD0..0xD7       EVM / SVM / GPU  dst = I64(0), skip six bytes
//! ```
//!
//! A program that read `array[0]` therefore returned `0` on chain rather than failing, a program
//! that asked for the block height got `0`, an EVM call reported success with a zero result, and a
//! GPU signature check that never ran returned `I64(0)`. `AGENTS.md` §5 says uncertainty must not
//! become success and §18 says an accelerator must never be accepted merely because it answered;
//! these arms did both. The six-byte skip was also wrong for most of the intrinsics (`EvmSstore` is
//! three bytes, `SvmCreateAccount` seven), so the arms desynchronised the instruction stream.
//!
//! These tests hold the on-chain interpreter to the opposite rule: an opcode it cannot really
//! execute is refused, by name, before it is answered.

//! `emit` reaches the receipt, and both engines journal the same events (X3-LANG-001).
//!
//! `emit` was refused at MIR lowering with "it has no lowering that preserves its meaning", and the
//! refusal was right about the tree: **neither** interpreter implemented opcode `0xA2`. The `std`
//! VM carried an `EventBuffer` that no instruction ever filled, the receipt's `logs` field was set
//! to `vec![]` beside a note saying collection was "deferred to runtime integration", and the
//! backend's encoder put the event's name in a constant-pool index the MIR lowering had no way to
//! produce. A program whose receipt is supposed to carry an event produced a receipt without one.
//!
//! These tests compile real `.x3` source and require the two engines — `crates/x3-vm`, which tools
//! and simulation reach, and `mini_x3`, which a block runs — to journal the same events for it.

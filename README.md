## ⚡ Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Wait for Build to Complete ⏳
```bash
# 3 parallel builds running:
# - Core node binary (30-60 min)
# - Phase 4 tests (15-30 min)
# - GPU-validator build (30-60 min)

# Monitor progress
ps aux | grep cargo | grep -v grep | wc -l  # Should see multiple processes
```

### Step 2: Verify It's Ready ✅
```bash
cd /home/lojak/Desktop/X3_ATOMIC_STAR

# Check binary exists
ls -lh target/release/x3-chain-node

# Verify tests pass
cargo test --lib tests_phase4 -- --nocapture
# Expected: test result: ok. 65 passed; 0 failed
```

### Step 3: Launch Testnet 🚀
```bash
# Simplest (development mode)
./target/release/x3-chain-node --chain dev --rpc-external

# Then in another terminal
curl http://localhost:9933 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"system_health","params":[],"id":1}' | jq
```

**That's it!** Your testnet is now running.

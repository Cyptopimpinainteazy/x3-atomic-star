# check-no-hardcoded-desktop-paths.sh — fail when a script on the bring-up path
# hardcodes an absolute /home/<user>/Desktop/ path.
#
# Why this exists: several scripts and systemd units named
# `/home/lojak/Desktop/X3_ATOMIC_STAR`, a directory that does not exist on this
# box. The failure mode is nasty — one script `mkdir -p`'d the missing root and
# then reported `manifest path tests/e2e/Cargo.toml does not exist`, which reads
# like a missing crate rather than a wrong root. The operator is about to bring
# up seven physical validator servers, so every entry point on that path has to
# work from a checkout at any path.
#
# Scope: tracked shell entry points under `scripts/` and at the repository root,
# plus the systemd units under `scripts/`. `%h/Desktop/...` is *not* flagged —
# that is systemd's portable home specifier, not a hardcoded user path.
#
# A line is allowed only when it carries one of the documented override tokens
# below; each allowance is printed on every run so it stays visible.
#
# Usage: scripts/check-no-hardcoded-desktop-paths.sh [--quiet]

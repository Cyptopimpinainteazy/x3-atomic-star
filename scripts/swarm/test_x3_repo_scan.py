"""Fixture-driven tests for the X3 repo scanner.

The scanner's job is to say true things about a tree, so the tests build trees:
one with nothing wrong in it (the negative control — a scanner that always finds
something fails here) and one with exactly one instance of each defect it claims
to detect. Assertions name the file and symbol, not just a count, because a
count-only assertion passes when the finding moves somewhere useless.

`swarm_scan_generates_report` is the name `FEATURE_REGISTRY.toml` cites for
`[repo_scanner_agent]`; `test_swarm_scan_generates_report` is the pytest-visible
alias, so the citation resolves to a function a gate actually runs.

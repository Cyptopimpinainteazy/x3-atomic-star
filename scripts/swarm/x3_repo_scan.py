"""X3 repo scanner: findings a person can act on, not a markdown dump.

`scripts/swarm/swarm_scan.sh` used to dump every `TODO|FIXME|unwrap(` line and a
list of filenames whose name contained a subsystem word. Nothing in that output
said what was wrong, where the symbol was, which gate would catch it, or what to
do about it, and no test or gate ran it.

This scanner emits a **finding schema** instead. Every finding carries:

    id, severity, kind, path, line, symbol, why, suggested_fix, test_required,
    gate_affected

and is written to both `reports/swarm_scan_report.md` (readable) and
`reports/swarm_scan_findings.json` (machine-readable). Findings are sorted by
severity, then kind, then path, then line, so two runs over the same tree produce
byte-identical output.

What it deliberately does **not** re-implement:

* `TODO`/`FIXME`/stub markers and test cheats are owned by
  `scripts/x3_fake_code_scan.py`, which has its own ratchet and its own gates.
* `unwrap()`/`expect()`/`panic!` in reachable production code is owned by
  `scripts/audit/panic_unwrap_scan.py` and `scripts/mainnet/panic_unwrap_audit.sh`.

The scanner *runs* those two and folds their verdicts into `gate_summary` below,
so one command answers "what is wrong" and "which of the existing ratchets is
currently red". Re-reporting their findings as its own would be a second ratchet
over the same debt, so it does not.

What it does check that nothing else did (see `STRUCTURAL_KINDS`):

* `stale-registry-test` — a `required_tests` entry that names a function which
  exists nowhere. The readiness gate only resolves citations whose
  `crate_or_service` is a *directory* holding `.rs` files, so a row pointing at a
  script could cite a test nobody wrote and still pass. One did.
* `missing-registry-path` — a `crate_or_service` that is not in the tree.
* `stale-proof-report` — a `proof_report` that points at nothing.
* `unregistered-pallet` — a `pallets/*` crate `runtime/src/lib.rs` never mentions.
* `pallet-call-without-weights` — a `#[pallet::call]` block in a pallet that has no
  `WeightInfo` anywhere, the exact shape of the hand-written weights file that
  PR #519 shipped broken.
* `ungated-crate` — a crate with test attributes that no gate runs, including
  crates whose tests run only through a wrapper script a gate invokes (`run-expiry-test.sh`
  is such a wrapper; the unwired `scripts/check-crate-tests-are-gated.py` cannot see it).

Patches: findings whose remediation is mechanical and safe set `patch_eligible`,
and `--patches` writes a real unified diff to `.ai/patches/<id>.patch`. Nothing is
ever applied to the tree; a human still reviews and applies. Only `ungated-crate`
qualifies today: the fix is one line appended to a gate list, and the diff is
computed from the file's actual bytes.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/swarm/x3_repo_scan.py                    # scan, write reports
    python3 scripts/swarm/x3_repo_scan.py --json             # findings on stdout
    python3 scripts/swarm/x3_repo_scan.py --patches          # + .ai/patches/*.patch
    python3 scripts/swarm/x3_repo_scan.py --check            # fail on ratchet growth
    python3 scripts/swarm/x3_repo_scan.py --root <dir>       # scan a fixture tree

//! A compiled X3BC artifact for the kernel's benchmarks, and the tests that keep it honest.
//!
//! `submit_comit_v2`'s X3 payload is the *compiled program*, and the adapter that runs it validates
//! the envelope (magic, format version, minimum loader version, body checksum). A benchmark cannot
//! compile a program inside the wasm runtime, so the bytes are embedded here — and the source they
//! came from is embedded beside them, with a test that recompiles it and requires the two to match.
//!
//! Without that test this would be a hand-assembled fixture, which is the shape that hid a reader
//! which never checked a checksum (TICKET-108): a fixture that is not what the compiler emits cannot
//! tell "the runtime accepted my program" from "the runtime accepted my bytes".

/// The `.x3` source the fixture is compiled from. Kept here so the bytes are reviewable as a program
/// rather than as an opaque blob.

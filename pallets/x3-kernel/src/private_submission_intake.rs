//! The compiled private-submission policy as the chain's intake path enforces it (X3-MEV-002).
//!
//! The MEV/privacy work in this repository had a structural gap for a long time: the X3 language
//! toolchain compiles a `require_private_submission` policy into an executable demand, and
//! `pallet-x3-kernel` executes the artifact — but the chain-intake compiler (`crates/x3-compiler`,
//! behind `x3-integration::compiler_bridge`) had no notion of submission policy at all, so a program
//! that reached the chain could not demand private submission *even in principle*. The demand and
//! the enforcement lived on opposite sides of a boundary nothing crossed.
//!
//! The fix has two halves, and these tests exist because either half alone is worthless:
//!
//! * the compiler *records* the demand in the artifact's own feature word
//!   (`x3_common::bytecode::FEATURE_PRIVATE_SUBMISSION_REQUIRED`), so the requirement travels with
//!   the bytes rather than with a submission-time parameter a caller could omit (AGENTS.md §11);
//! * the pallet *reads* it at intake and refuses the program when the runtime's
//!   `Config::PrivateSubmissionChannel` says this chain cannot offer what the program demands.
//!
//! Every test drives the real extrinsic. The extractions that make the check load-bearing:
//!
//! * refusal must not be a refusal of *any* X3 payload — the same call with the same source
//!   compiled without the demand must run, or the check is indistinguishable from a broken adapter;
//! * the demand must be read out of the header, so a module whose feature word is edited after
//!   compilation is refused even though no compiler ever saw it (this is also why the edit does not
//!   invalidate the envelope: the checksum covers the body, and the test asserts that);
//! * the accepting direction must reach the ledger, so "accepted" cannot mean "accepted and did
//!   nothing".
